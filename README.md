## GA PROJECT 2 // A FULL-CRUD NODE/EXPRESS/MONGODB WEB APP 
&nbsp;
#### This is an interactive web app that allows users to track their personal wine inventory, build locations to tag to their wines, and leave tasting notes on wines.
&nbsp;
> _Users are able to view a complete location guide that contains all of the locations that have been created by all users, and tag those locations on any of the wines they've created.
> Users are also able to create, read, update, and delete wines, locations, and tasting notes that they've created!_
